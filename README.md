# RL
## RL solving Highway environments

The goal of this project is to create differents agents to sole differents highway environments with discrete sets of actions or states.

- Erwan DAVID
- Guillaume FAYNOT

## Requirements

Install the requirements in the file [`requirements.txt`]('./requirements.txt')

## Run the simulation 

Train your agent on a specific environment by one of the following command in the appropriate folder :

`python3 main1.py`
`python3 main2.py`
`python3 main3.py`

Run the appropriate notebook (main1.ipynb, main2.ipynb or main3.ipynb) to try your agent in the environment.

## Models

The project includes three different environments solved with various RL algorithms:

1. **Environment 1**: A classic highway environment solved using DQN with continuous states and discrete actions.
2. **Environment 2**: A racetrack environment solved using PPO with discrete states and continuous actions.
3. **Environment 3**: A highway merging scenario solved using Stable-Baselines3.
